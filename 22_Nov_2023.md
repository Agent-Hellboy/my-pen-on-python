# Python Ping vs. Linux Ping

This project demonstrates how the Python `pythonping` library is faster than the `ping` command utility in Linux. funny right :)

## Description

The `pythonping` library provides a Python interface for sending ICMP echo requests (pings) to remote hosts. 

It allows you to measure the round-trip time (RTT) for each ping and provides statistics such as minimum, average, and maximum RTT.


In comparison, the `ping` command utility in Linux performs synchronous calls and sends a fixed number of packets (`-c 20` in this case) to the remote host. 

It also calculates statistics like minimum, average, maximum, and standard deviation of the RTT.

## Results

Running the Python script using the `pythonping` library showed the following results:

```
Round Trip Times min/avg/max is 6.51/10.9/20.48 ms

Round Trip Times min/avg/max is 5.28/10.61/21.38 ms


Execution time:  0.07168316841125488

```

On the other hand, running the `ping` command utility in Linux showed the following results:

```

### Benchmarking Code 

python:

```py

from threading import Thread
from pythonping import ping
import time

def print_ping(arg):
    print(ping('www.google.com'))

start_time = time.time()

threads = []
for i in range(20):
    t = Thread(target=print_ping, args=(i,))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

# Join all the threads
for t in threads:
    t.join()

end_time = time.time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
print("Execution time: ", execution_time)

```

Linux:

``time ping -c 20 google.com``
